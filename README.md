# <p align="center"> Mobile Price Prediction

# 1.	Introduction
We started building our own company for mobile phones (phoneky). We want to fight a tough battle with big companies like Apple, Samsung, etc.
We don't know how to estimate the price of cell phones made by our company. In this competitive market for mobile phones, it is not enough to make random predictions and assumptions. To solve this problem, we collect mobile phone sales data from different companies.

<b>phoneky</b> want to discover some relationship between the features of a mobile phone (eg: - RAM, internal memory, etc.) and the selling price.
In this problem, you don't have to predict the actual price but the price range indicates how high the price will be
# 2.	Problem Statement
In this Project, based on the mobile Specification like Battery power, 3G enabled, wifi, Bluetooth, Ram, etc we are predicting the Price range of the mobile. This kind of prediction will help us estimate the price of mobiles to give tough competition to manufacturers Also it will be useful for Consumers to verify that they are paying the best price for mobile.


# 3.	Dataset

Dataset as 21 features and 2000 entries, we will use data [mobile phone](https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification) from Kaggle.<br>Here are the features of the dataset:
